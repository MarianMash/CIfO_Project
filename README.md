# CIfO_Project
This is my twofold CIfO-Project about Particle Swarm Neural Network Weight Optimization and Genetic Feature Selection.
It was a graded Computational Informatics for Optimization project of my Advanced Analytics and Data Science Masters Degree of Nova University in Lisbon.

Since this project is twofold you can use the:
  Feature Selection tool by excecuting "Genetic_Algo.py"
   - all operators are stored in files in charles folder
